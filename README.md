True Ultra Graphics Settings for WoW Classic

This Add-On puts and hold every graphic setting to the max allowed by the engine.

It increases settings present in-game above their limit, but also hidden settings.

 

Despite what some people think, entering a graphic value above cap won't change the setting at all in most cases.

Some of them must be exactly the max value. I tested every value to be sure they work.

Check screenshots for better reference.

 

For some settings to work, first you must add the following lines to "Config.wtf" inside "WTF" folder:

 


    SET spelleffectlevel ""
    SET smallcull ""
    SET extshadowquality ""
    SET showfootprints ""
    SET environmentDetail ""
    SET detailDoodadAlpha ""
    SET characterAmbient ""
    SET overridefarclip ""
    SET horizonfarclip ""


 

Copy/Paste them at the bottom of the config file without any instance of WoW running, save and install the Add-On.

 

The more remarkable improvements are:

Weather Particles Density - Spell FX Density - Object Draw Distance - Visible Footprints

Grass Draw Distance - Distant Textures Definition - Ghost Glow Removal - Blood Level

 

For BCC and WotLKC version now also sets the nameplates distance to its max setting of 41 yd.

 

Opening the system window overrides custom settings.

You can use "/reload" or wait for the next loggin to get the Add-On values again.
